# mt19937-archive

This is a reconstructed revision history for the MT19937 Mersenne Twister
pseudorandom number generator by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.

It combines files from [Matsumoto](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404003059/http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/emt.html)
and [Nishimura's](https://web.archive.org/web/20020804170007/http://www.math.keio.ac.jp:80/~nisimura/random/)
archived sites at Keio University and [Matsumoto's current site](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/m-mat/MT/emt.html)
at Hiroshima University and was generated by scripts in the
[repo-archival project](https://github.com/thaliaarchi/repo-archival/tree/main/scripts/mt19937).
Both authors have slightly different changes, which I have carefully merged.
Missing revisions, that I inferred from timestamps and analogous changes, are
denoted with `~` in `git log`. Releases are tagged.

See [readme-mt.txt](readme-mt.txt) for documentation and usage instructions.
