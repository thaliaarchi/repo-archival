Hello Thalia,

I've attached a copy of my original trans32.py file. (BTW, I notice that it contains a link to a no-longer-existing site for the Whitespace language definition.) Good luck with your project!

Hello r.e.s.,

While collecting community projects\[0] relating to the Whitespace programming language, I ran across a 2012 Code Golf post of yours\[1], where you mention Binary Whitespace, a scheme you came up with to encode Whitespace’s three tokens as two. The Python source for it, trans32.py, and your Whitespace programs were not archived when the site went down\[2]. Since this is the first mention I’ve seen of such an encoding and I have been keeping track of the history of Whitespace, it’s of particular interest to me. Plus, I happened to come up with the same bitwise encoding in 2018 and implemented it in several interpreters and compilers. It would be interesting to see how it compares.

Do you still have the source for that Binary Whitespace translator or any of your Whitespace programs or projects?
