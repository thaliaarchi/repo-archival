as_tepigmc '2015-01-01 10:58 -0800' git commit -q --allow-empty -m 'Make papercraft generator for pigs

It has options to enable helmets, boots, and saddles that can be
attached to the pig or as seperate pieces. The head of the pig fits on
the pig like in minecraft. The nose is 3D and there is an option to make
it be flat instead.'

as_ppa '2015-02-07 08:39 -0600' git commit -q -m 'Add support for user input variables

I'"'"'ve finally managed to get some time to work on the generator again
and have now added variables for you to use.

For now I'"'"'ve added support for booleans, select lists and a range of
integer values. You can read about them on the Generator Builder page
under "Getting User Input":
https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000246/http://pixelpapercraft.com/generator-builder

I'"'"'ve also added your generator to the site so we can test it out and
review. Once we feel it'"'"'s ready then we can officially announce it.'

as_tepigmc '2015-02-26 17:19 -0800' git commit -q --allow-empty -m 'Various fixes

I have done some testing. I was using `Generator.drawTexture` instead
of `Generator.drawImage`, so I fixed that. I also removed the checks
for non-existent textures because that broke it as well. I also changed
some things with the images, drawing, user inputs and probably other
stuff too.'

as_tepigmc '2015-02-28 12:21 -0800' git commit -q --allow-empty -m 'Use sprite files

I have finished the changes. All the images are compacted into sprite
files (similar to CSS sprites) and the script draws them from there. I
added the standard version for Advanced Head and also an option to
enable helmet overlays (some textures like Sphax have multiple layers).
I thoroughly tested it and it is ready to post.'

as_tepigmc '2015-03-01 09:59 -0800' git commit -q --allow-empty -m 'Finish generator

The generator is officially (I think) complete. You can post it to the
site and the news now. I also took another picture for the generator
and changed the readme. The site doesnâ€™t need the folder
`image\seperated` and `image\Readme.md`. Those files are just to help
other people change the images.'

as_ppa '2015-03-01 00:04:09 -0600' git commit -q --allow-empty -m 'Release the new version to the site

I'"'"'ve made some small formatting changes to the script.

I'"'"'ll officially announce your generator on the blog within the next day or two.'

# Zip does not store timezone, so it extracts in the local timezone.
# The latest contained file, pig-advanced/Script.txt, was modified
# 2015-03-09 19:38:30 locally and the HTTP Last-Modified header is
# 2015-03-09 08:45:11 +0000, which make no sense together. The effective
# timezone would have shifted every time it was zipped in another timezone.
# As far as I can tell, though, zips were only made on my end (-0800). Since I
