### Mercurial repository

https://bitbucket-archive.softwareheritage.org/projects/in/inferno-os/inferno-os-hg.html
https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os-hg

### Current repository

https://github.com/inferno-os/inferno-os (current)
https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os/ (old)

The Bitbucket repo used to be the main source, but development seems to now have
switched to GitHub. The last common commit was on 2021-10-11 and any commits
after that on Bitbucket are cherry-picked from GitHub.

## Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous repos, that are not on both forges:

- https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/java2dis/: Java class file execution in
  Inferno's Dis VM
- https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/browser-plugin/: Inferno as an old IE
  browser plugin
- https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/owen/: Computational grid
- https://github.com/inferno-os/ventivac: Venti components for Inferno (GSoC)
- https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno64-os/: History is fully included in
  inferno-os/inferno-os, so it seems to serve no purpose
