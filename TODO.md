    grafted history of Linux 0.01 to 2.6, which combines repos from Dave Jones
    (0.01 to 2.4.0), tglx (2.4.0 to 2.6.12), and Linus Torvalds (2.6.12 to 2.6),
    prepared by Yoann Padioleau, and uploaded to IA by Jason Scott.

  - [linux-bitkeeper](https://github.com/dmgerman/linux-bitkeeper):
    Linux 2.4.0 through 2.6.12-rc2.
    It starts with an import of 2.4.0 through 2.5.3 on 2002-02-04 and
    development afterwards uses BitKeeper.
  - [linux-pre-history](https://github.com/dmgerman/linux-pre-history):
    Linux 0.01 through 2.4.0.
    Commits authored by linus1 \<torvalds@linuxfoundation.org> from 1991-09-17 to 2000-12-31

- JavaScript 1.0
  - [doodlewind/mocha1995](https://github.com/doodlewind/mocha1995) extracts
    Mocha from the same archive as I am doing. It is done by the Chinese
    translator of “JavaScript: The First 20 Years”.
  - I think JavaScript was originally distributed as JSRef (JavaScript
    reference) before SpiderMonkey. Rhino [refers to it](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/arch/i386_rh9/build/README.html).
    Maybe I could find a pre-Netscape 3.02 version. However, this [source tree](https://github.com/zii/netscape/tree/master/js/ref)
    for Netscape, has JSRef and appears to be after Mocha.
  - [Rhino](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/doc/rhino/index.html) is an
    implementation of JavaScript in Java, from [fall 1997](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/doc/rhino/history.html),
    when a version of Netscape entirely in Java was in the works
- PCRE release archives
