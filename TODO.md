# TODO

- Plan 9
  - ISO and tar releases: https://p9f.org/dl/index.html
  - UC Berkeley GPL: https://github.com/brho/plan9
- JavaScript 1.0
  - [doodlewind/mocha1995](https://github.com/doodlewind/mocha1995) extracts
    Mocha from the same archive as I am doing. It is done by the Chinese
    translator of “JavaScript: The First 20 Years”.
  - I think JavaScript was originally distributed as JSRef (JavaScript
    reference) before SpiderMonkey. Rhino [refers to it](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/arch/i386_rh9/build/README.html).
    Maybe I could find a pre-Netscape 3.02 version. However, this [source tree](https://github.com/zii/netscape/tree/master/js/ref)
    for Netscape, has JSRef and appears to be after Mocha.
  - [Rhino](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/doc/rhino/index.html) is an
    implementation of JavaScript in Java, from [fall 1997](https://web.mit.edu/javascript/doc/rhino/history.html),
    when a version of Netscape entirely in Java was in the works
